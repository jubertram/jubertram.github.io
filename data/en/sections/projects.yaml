  summary: Tracer is a web application to allow Parkour practitioners to find places where to do this sport, with the possible movements according to these places. This is the final project I did at the end of my Bootcamp. We were 4 to work 8 days on this project. I was the team leader in charge of the overall management of the project as well as its production on Heroku. I mainly worked on the back end and on the mapbox integration.
